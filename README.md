# Welcome to C# Advanced

This course would be an addition to the previous one, C# Basic. Through out this 15 module course we will cover some more advanced topics and features of the C# language as well as try to build a small application as a workshop. Since it is an advanced subject, the aims will be to work more individually, solve problems, find solutions and tackle issues so that we set a good foundation and good working habits and practices. Hope you have fun and good luck ðŸ˜‰

**On this subject you already know the basics of C# and you are ready for some advanced concepts and features. The focus will also be to build good programming habits and start working on problems and solutions individualy.  With that in mind we will learn:**

* How to implement advanced object oriented concepts
* How to build applications with advanced features
* How the .NET Framework works in a bit more depth
* Advanced features of the C# language in general
